Phill's Arbitrary Group Calendars
=================================

[ WARNING: I haven't finished this app. It does nothing at the moment ]

Generate a calendar for a group of exchange users arbitrarily
and provide urls/images that can be embedded into other things
like Wiki's, emails, websites and dashboards!

h2. The problems

* You don't want to waste time inserting your holiday into multiple
calendars for the various teams you are a part of.

* You forget to change the calendars when an appointment changes

* It's 9am. You're in standup. Johan isn't here and you aren't sure
if he's on holiday, in other meeting, or you should wait a few minutes
for him to arrive.

* You glance up from your computer screen to realise you're alone and
little scared. Find out if your colleagues have headed to a meeting
that somehow didn't make it in your Exchange calendar.

* Not only is your boss away from his desk but all the Heads of Tech
are. So where are they?

* You want to know what's in your calendar but you'd rather not use
Outlook, Web Outlook or Thunderbird to find out.

h2. The solution?

* A single page web app. Shove a list of users and a "view" style
into the form and hit generate. Provided you like the result, copy
the url, save the image or otherwise embed the link in your corporate
wikis, big screen tvs or where-ever you want.

h2. Why did you write this?

* I expect it to be useful
* I wanted to learn Scala
* I wanted to try Functional Programming even though my book on Functional Programming in Scala hasn't arrived yet.

h2. How I use this app?
